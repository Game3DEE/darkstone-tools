# Darkstone Tools

This repository contains Darkstone modding tools. You can install them using NodeJS npm by using:

    npm install -g @game3dee/darkstone-tools

See below for a list of tools included.

## MTF

This tool enables you to extract MTF files, and create them. Please note that currently compression is not supported, so if you extract and recreate an MTF file, it'll likely be much bigger.

Extraction:

    mtf extract myquest.mtf /path/where/I/unpack

Creation:

    mtf create mynewshiny.mtf /path/from/where/I/pack
